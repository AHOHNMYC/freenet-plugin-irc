Release:

- TESTING!

- don't rejoin a channel, over, and over, and over... again
- cancelling older requests doesn't seem to work (should be fixed... TEST)
- don't request a key too often, just ugly
- Implement WHO usernames listing for a channel, some IRC clients require this
- Trigger a part after we haven't seen an identity for a long time

Next version(s):

- check trust of a hinted identity (calculated trust, not manually assigned)
- properly use rank for first identity listeners
- do proper logging instead of writing to stdout
- sample identity hints from all channels instead of the current associated one
- private encrypted channels
- personal messages?
- support topics
