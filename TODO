Release:

- provide feedback through setting a usermode on whether or not a specific nick is likely to see our messages
-- implemented, now actually test whether this works or not (mode setting by non-ops ignored by irssi???)

- sample identity hints from all channels instead of the current associated one
- provide simple instructions when visiting the plugin through http

- better pings:
	Processing line from client: PING test
	Sending line to client: :test PONG test :test

Next versions:

- cancel ULPR's for older timestamps
- publish the fact that we are leaving a channel to freenet (which is different from a timeout)
- private encrypted channels
- do proper logging instead of writing to stdout
- personal messages?
