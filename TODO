Release:

- stop publisher when quiting the server == really cleanup after yourself
- fix issues with rejoining a channel (irssi timeout), re-assign existing publishers? or don't create a new publisher...
- actually use identity hints
- sample identity hints from all channels instead of the current associated one

Next versions:

- usermodes for indicating whether we're sure that some other client is monitoring us (and therefore will see our output)
- publish the fact that we are leaving a channel to freenet (which is different from a timeout)
- support notices for notifying the client when we've synched to our own publishing feed
- private encrypted channels
- do proper logging instead of writing to stdout
- personal messages?
