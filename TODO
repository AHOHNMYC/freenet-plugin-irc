Release:

- support changing a nick and give feedback for when the nick is not okay (server notice???)
-- add NICK message (we already have that...), the behaviour for a nick changes, we need to modify a lot of arrays, because nicks are primary keys towards users???, joining channels is just forbidden without a proper nick, so check for that

- provide simple instructions when visiting the plugin through http
- actually use identity hints
- sample identity hints from all channels instead of the current associated one

Next versions:

- cancel ULPR's for older timestamps
- usermodes for indicating whether we're sure that some other client is monitoring us (and therefore will see our output)
- publish the fact that we are leaving a channel to freenet (which is different from a timeout)
- support notices for notifying the client when we've synched to our own publishing feed
- private encrypted channels
- do proper logging instead of writing to stdout
- personal messages?
