Release:

- actually use identity hints
- provide feedback through setting a usermode on whether or not a specific nick is likely to see our messages
- sample identity hints from all channels instead of the current associated one
- provide simple instructions when visiting the plugin through http

- better pings:
	Processing line from digger3: PING test
	Sending line to digger3: :test PONG test :test

Next versions:

- cancel ULPR's for older timestamps
- usermodes for indicating whether we're sure that some other client is monitoring us (and therefore will see our output)
- publish the fact that we are leaving a channel to freenet (which is different from a timeout)
- support notices for notifying the client when we've synched to our own publishing feed
- private encrypted channels
- do proper logging instead of writing to stdout
- personal messages?
