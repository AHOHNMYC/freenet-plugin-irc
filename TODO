Release:

-- update the identities in the channel accordingly when calibrated, no when receiving a new message AFTER being calibrated
-- process privmsgs
-- send received freenetclientinput to local clients
-- expire old connections
-- support leaving a channel timeout / explicitly


- redo distribution of messages to local and remote connections
- publish the fact that we are leaving a channel to freenet (which is different from a timeout)
- provide simple instructions when visiting the plugin through http
- check trust of a hinted identity (calculated trust, not manually assigned)
- properly use rank for first identity listeners

Next version(s):

- do proper logging instead of writing to stdout
- discover other channels (support /list)
- sample identity hints from all channels instead of the current associated one
- cancel ULPR's for older timestamps
- private encrypted channels
- personal messages?
- support topics
